# Conversion Funnel & Retention Analysis (Excel / Google Sheets)

## Overview
This analysis evaluates how users progress through key engagement milestones and identifies where the greatest drop-off occurs. A cohort-based retention analysis was also conducted to understand how user behavior changes across acquisition periods.

## Key Findings
- The **largest drop-off occurred at the “Add to Cart” step**, indicating friction or hesitation before committing to purchase.
- This insight suggests opportunities to optimize product page clarity, value messaging, or checkout flow to reduce abandonment.

## Business Impact
Improving conversion at this single step could significantly increase revenue without needing to acquire additional users.

## Tools Used
- Google Sheets / Excel (Pivot tables, cohort retention model)
- Data cleaning and segmentation

## Future Improvements
- Compare behavior by acquisition channel (ads vs. organic vs. referral).
- Test UI/UX changes with A/B experiments to improve add-to-cart rate.
- Extend retention analysis to include purchase frequency or repeat orders.
