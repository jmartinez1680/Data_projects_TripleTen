# Superstore Returns Analysis (Tableau Story)

## Overview
This project explores patterns in product returns to understand where losses are occurring and identify operational and behavioral factors contributing to elevated return rates. The analysis was built as a Tableau Story to communicate findings visually and support decision-making at the executive level.

## Key Findings
- There was **no single cause** of high return volume; rather, returns were driven by **multiple interacting factors**.
- The **West region** showed the **highest return rate by a significant margin**, indicating possible logistical, customer expectation, or distributor-related issues.
- Certain return patterns suggested **potential fraudulent or opportunistic behavior**, particularly in high-discount, low-loyalty segments.

## Business Impact
High return rates reduce profit margins and inflate operational cost across shipping, processing, and restocking. Understanding where returns occur more frequently enables targeted interventions.

## Tools Used
- Tableau (Story, dashboards, drill-down visualizations)
- Spreadsheet data preparation

## Future Improvements
- Segment customers to identify whether **first-time vs. repeat buyers** behave differently.
- Analyze **order discount patterns** to quantify the link between discounting and fraudulent return behavior.
- Expand analysis by combining CRM or customer lifetime value data to identify which returns are most costly.
