## Key Findings
- The **strongest predictor of app success was review volume.** Apps with more customer reviews consistently ranked higher and attracted more installs.
- This suggests that **social proof and customer trust** play a significant role in app discovery and conversion.
- Pricing strategy alone did not determine success — many of the most successful apps used **mid-tier or usage-based pricing models** rather than being the lowest-cost option.

## Business Impact
Developers aiming to grow user adoption should invest in **review acquisition and customer engagement** strategies rather than competing solely on price.

## Tools Used
- Power BI (Dashboard, data modeling, DAX calculations)
- Excel / CSV data formatting

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate time-series analysis to observe app growth over time.
- Analyze developer portfolio strategies (single-purpose vs. multi-product offerings).
- Add segmentation based on app category (marketing, operations, storefront, etc.).
