\## About Me

I am a data-focused problem solver transitioning from mortgage operations into Business Intelligence. In my previous roles, I worked in environments that required accuracy, deadline management, and cross-team communication. I bring this attention to detail into my analytical work — transforming data into meaningful insights that stakeholders can act on.
